This is an implementation of linked lists in MIPS Assembly for my computer
organization class.

The program includes subroutines for making nodes, insertion, and traversal. The
program can be run in QtSpim.

I wrote a portion of the "new" routine and all of "insert" and "print." The
program inserts the values of the "input" label from least to greatest.
